# Cache Implementation Simulation

Client/server simulation for storing data, with AVL Tree database and cache

This is only a client usage simulation, as the client side isn't implemented yet. The server side is implemented in fully in pure Java.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE
3. Run the `Main` class

## How it works

The client has a console options to interact with the server. The server has a database implemented with AVL Tree and a cache implemented with a simple FIFO algorithm.
